# Pizza_Case_Study

This SQL project revolves around a database schema designed to manage and analyze data for a pizza store. 
The database consists of four primary tables: order_details, pizzas, orders, and pizza_types.
Each table plays a crucial role in storing different facets of the business operations, from individual orders to the types of pizzas offered.

Relevance to a Pizza Sales Store Manager:

A pizza sales store manager can utilize this SQL project to extract valuable insights and conduct detailed data analysis, 
facilitating informed decision-making and efficient management of the store's operations. 

- Sales Analysis: By querying the order_details and pizzas tables, managers can identify the best-selling pizzas, assess revenue from different pizza sizes, and evaluate pricing strategies.
- Inventory Management: Analyzing the pizza_types and their ingredients helps in managing inventory more efficiently, ensuring that ingredients are stocked according to demand and reducing waste.
- Customer Preferences: Through data gathered in the orders and pizzas tables, managers can track customer preferences over time,
adjusting the menu to cater to popular choices and experimenting with new or seasonal offerings.
